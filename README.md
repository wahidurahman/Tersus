# Altus

Hi! 

Small businesses in the last decade have seen incredible leaps forward in their embrace of technology. Companies like Square, Clover, Salesforce and Uber have been large enablers of this digital migration. However, there has been a massive lag as to what the data processed by these operators can mean towards a business. In short, insights suck.

Altus is looking to act on existing infrastructure and extrapolate further on what data already exists to pass on useful information and recommendations to enable small businesses to make the right choices and optimize their operations.
